       "4  \"who do you think should do the killing?\"\\n\\nAnyone and everyone. This is a community problem, so everyone who wants to be part of the solution should be allowed to help. As I said above: remove all protections on free ranging cats, and allow people to help. People who allow their pets to roam outside are part of the problem, because their pets are part of the problem. It would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.\\n\\nYears ago some Vermont acquaintances got one warning from the Ranger: Next time I see your dog running deer, I'll shoot it. Next time she saw it running deer, she did. \\n\\nVermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves. If we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. Neutered cats eat birds. Don't release them. Kill them.  "

What I do care about is the damage he's already caused to this country, and the continuing damage he'll cause to this country and the world until he leaves office.  \n",
